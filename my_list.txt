Original / Romaji Lyrics	English Translation
Are wa dare da dare da dare da
Are wa debiru Debiruman Debiruman

Who is that? Who, who?
That's Devilman, Devilman!

Uragirimono no na wo ukete
Subete wo sutete tatakau otoko
Debiru Arrow wa chouonpa 
Debiru Ear wa jigokumimi
Debiru Wingu wa sora wo tobi
Debiru Biimu wa netsu kousen

Taking the name of the traitor
The man who abandoned everything to fight
His devil arrows are supersonic
His devil ears are straight from hell
His devil wings soar in the sky
His devil beam is a burning wave

Akuma no chikara mi ni tsuketa
Seigi no hero Debiruman Debiruman

He took the power of the devil
The hero of justice, Devilman!

Hajimete shitta hito no ai
Sono yasashisa ni mezameta otoko
Debiru choppu wa panchiryoku
Debiru kikku wa hakairyoku
Debiru ai nara toushiryoku 
Debiru katta wa iwa kudaku

The first time he knew the love of a person
The man who awakened to that kindness
His devil chop has a fist's power
His devil kick has destructive power
His devil eyes can see through all
His devil cutter blasts through rocks

Akuma no chikara mi ni tsuketa
Seigi no hero Debiruman Debiruman

He took the power of the devil,
The hero of justice, Devilman!

Are wa dare da dare da dare da
Are wa debiru Debiruman Debiruman

Who is that, who, who?
That's Devilman, Devilman!

Uragirimono no na wo ukete
Subete wo sutete tatakau otoko
Debiru Arrow wa chouonpa 
Debiru Ear wa jigokumimi
Debiru Wingu wa sora wo tobi
Debiru Biimu wa netsu kousen

Taking the name of the traitor
The man who abandoned everything to fight
His devil arrows are supersonic
His devil ears are straight from hell
His devil wings soar in the sky
His devil beam is a burning wave

Akuma no chikara mi ni tsuketa
Seigi no hero Debiruman Debiruman

He took the power of the devil
The hero of justice, Devilman!
